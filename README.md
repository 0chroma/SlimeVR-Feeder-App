# SlimeVR Feeder Application

TODO

It might be worth switching away from C++ because build systems/library management is a pain!
I'd use rust but rust's openvr stuff is... out of date and unmaintained.
maybe c#?

create default bindings for the boolean actions (possibly involving chording?)

I think the choices made here regarding how to find/sort controllers is somewhat dubious, and out-of-date with slimevr.
The logic could use a re-do.

#### Thanks
This was largely based off of https://github.com/Omnifinity/OpenVR-Tracking-Example , even if the structure is different. Thanks, @Omnifinity.
